  "description": "Openvest is a fintech platform designed to break down the barriers of elite investing. For decades, access to hedge-fund and private-equity style portfolios was reserved for billionaires, institutions, and insiders. We change that.\nWith Openvest, anyone can invest in curated, high-performing strategies with just a few clicks. Our portfolios are built using proprietary data and research, delivering exposure to the same types of investments top funds use to outperform the market — now made simple, transparent, and affordable.\nLow entry point: Start investing with as little as $300.\nFlat pricing: Just $3/month flat max (no hidden 2% management fees or 20% carry).\nElite strategies: Portfolios designed to mirror the performance of top private equity and hedge funds.\nFast onboarding: A simple sign-up and funding process.\nInclusive access: Built for everyone! No just the super wealthy!\n",
